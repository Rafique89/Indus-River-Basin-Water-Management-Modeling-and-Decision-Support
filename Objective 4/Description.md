Population growth and climate change have exerted stress on freshwater resources and thus, food security is threatened. Developing countries are susceptible due to rapid population growth, scarce fresh water resources and inadequate capacity to cope with climate change. For sustainable development and Pakistan Vision 2025 goals to be achieved, a nexus approach is necessary to adopt synergies and avoid trade-offs in water-food sectors with emphasis on agriculture. Application of system dynamics modelling in nexus is largely an unexplored area. In this research, a system dynamic model has been developed relevant to agriculture sector of Pakistan with the aim of achieving security and realizing sustainable development goals related to water and food. Causal loop diagrams and stock-flow model are developed. Different scenarios are modelled based on various probable policy interventions in future.

The scenario of high land productivity was modelled to evaluate whether by doubling the agricultural productivity, food security can be achieved. The surprising outcome was that there is no need to increase the area under cultivation. Enhancing the productivity of the land alone will suffice. One scenario that shows an improved situation for food security is the improved livelihood scenario, in which population growth rate is kept below the baseline growth rate and reliance on crops, such as wheat and rice is decreased. Though, production is well above consumption until the end of the simulation period, there is an inherent problem with water security; when diets change, it does not guarantee that the water consumption in the agriculture sector is reduced. Unless efficient irrigation techniques are practiced. To study the impacts of climate change, an increase in maximum temperature values was modelled to discover variations in the evapotranspiration values and water consumption of crops. An increase of 0.75 Â°C in maximum temperature causes water consumption to increase by 1.42 and 0.24 km3 for wheat and rice, respectively.

In conclusion, to achieve food and water security, population growth rate must be maintained at a value less than the baseline value. Though the agriculture water requirement is increasing as more area is cultivated, water need for this expansion can be provided by increasing efficiency of the irrigation system, instead of drawing water from the municipal share.
