Pakistan’s water crisis is not merely about the water scarcity, but it is also the ineffective forms of governance which have been responsible for ineffective water management. As according to global water partnership’s framework for action (2000), “the water crisis is often a crisis of governance”, the inefficient supply of services due to mismanagement, and lack of appropriate institutions besides lack of human capacity has resulted in the insufficiency of water in the country. Thus, the governance which is all about making choices, decisions and tradeoffs need evidence-based analyses and information which can help improve the water governance through informed decision making (Olsson, 2015) (Falkenmark, 2008). Keeping in mind the present and future water crisis there are different management options, the approval and execution of these options are only possible when all the stakeholders agree on a feasible option that can solve water-related issues in Pakistan. Moreover, that is only possible when the options are evaluated in an integrated way (as shown in figure below) and presented to stakeholder with strong evidence supported by scientific data.

Keeping in view, the need of evidence-based decision support system, the US Pakistan center for advanced studies in water at Mehran University of engineering and technology-Jamshoro awarded a project titled as “Development of a decision support system for water resources planning and management in Pakistan” under the theme of strengthening the water governance. The prime goal of the project was to develop a baseline model and data dissemination portal for decision making for water resources and planning at the country level. The other goal was to build the capacity in Pakistan for developing and using decision support system for water resources planning and management.
In this project, an integrated data sharing and modeling prototype platform is implemented for standard online sharing of the data and decision making for water management and planning in Pakistan.
In the first phase, a data sharing platform is designed and implemented on the web-based server that has standard protocols for data sharing and formats. In this project, we have demonstrated that how the time series and geo-spatial data (that occurs mostly in water resources) can be arranged in a standard format and can be shared among the registered users. Implemented web portal can upload the data, so any registered organization can upload the relevant data and can be shared with other registered organization. This sets up a standard sharing mechanism within and among the organizations. We have also implemented a workflow for associating targets and indicators for international monitoring. This will provide the organization to map the shared data concerning the monitoring indicators.
