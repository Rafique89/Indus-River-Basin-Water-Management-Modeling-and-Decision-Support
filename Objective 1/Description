The water and agriculture sector in Pakistan is well monitored but it is hard to find its data on internet, the gap exist in the standardization of information and management sharing within and outside the departments. Presently there are no protocols that define the standard information and management sharing mechanism for the water sector. 
The focus of the first objective was to produce scientific-use research data for the water and irrigation organizations or similar backgrounds, for establishing the standardized data sharing among the water community. The vision for making the web based repository open source for further development of the repository by other organization/researchers.
