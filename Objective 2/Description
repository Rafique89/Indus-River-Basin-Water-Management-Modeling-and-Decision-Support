Water resources management and policy-making require an understanding of projected impacts of climate change on hydrological cycle components including precipitation and temperature. Global climate models (GCMs) are primary tools to simulate historical and projected changes in the hydro-climate variables. Due to their higher resolutions and inherent bias, the GCMs cannot be used in the climate change impact analysis. Such analyses need more accurate and high-resolution data. In this study, precipitation and mean temperature simulations from an ensemble of 10 GCMs that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-5 (CMIP5) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were downscaled to 1 km resolution using the quantile mapping-delta (QMD) method over Indus River Basin and Pakistan. 
The results show that the temperature is much more certain than precipitation. The projected changes in temperature are confident almost everywhere over the Indus Basin and Pakistan. It can be observed that the annual mean temperature has a consistent increasing trend throughout the basin. In the IRB, the annual mean temperature is projected to increase by 2 oC under RCP4.5 and 2.66 oC under RCP8.5 scenario. The projections also show consistent increase in the temperature in the IRB in winter season by 2.1 oC under RCP4.5 and 2.8 oC under RCP8.5 scenario. Similarly, the summer temperature is also projected to be increasing by 1.93 oC under RCP4.5 and 2.53 oC under RCP8.5 scenarios. However, in the summer season, the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) and western parts of the IRB will get more increase in the temperature under both scenarios.
 The results show that there is low confidence in how precipitation will change over most the region. It shows that for all seasons and most of the Indus Basin, future precipitation is highly uncertain. However, the climate models are confident that precipitation will increase in the Upper Indus Basin. The Upper Indus Basin has a great significance regarding hydrological features and hosts thousands of glaciers and number of high peaks. Therefore, precipitation and temperature changes will be of great impact on the flow of Indus River. The results show that the mean annual precipitation over the UIB is projected to be increasing by 14% and 19% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario respectively. The winter precipitation will also increase by 17% under RCP4.5 scenario and by 22% under RCP8.5 scenario. In the spring season, a slight increase of 3% is projected under both scenarios. The precipitation in the summer season is likely to increase by 14% and 18% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively. The precipitation in the autumn season is projected to remain same under RCP4.5 scenario and increase by 17% under RCP8.5 scenario respectively.
