### Overview of Project

The USAID-funded U.S.-Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Pakistan (USPCAS-W) conducted a flagship project from 2015 to 2017 to develop capacity to enable USPCAS-W decision support for Indus River management. The objectives of the Indus River Basin Water Management Modeling and Decision Support project were to (1) create a database supporting water management and system dynamics modeling of the Indus River Basin, (2) create a water management model using WEAP, (3) create a system dynamics model of the Indus River Basin, and (4) apply these two tools to produce results to inform decision making. This report summarizes all objectives and presents the challenges, pathways, solutions, and recommendations derived from this flagship project.
