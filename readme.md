### Abstract

The USAID-funded U.S.-Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Pakistan (USPCAS-W) conducted a flagship project from 2015 to 2017 to develop capacity to enable USPCAS-W decision support for Indus River management. The objectives of the Indus River Basin Water Management Modeling and Decision Support project were to (1) create a database supporting water management and system dynamics modeling of the Indus River Basin, (2) create a water management model using WEAP, (3) create a system dynamics model of the Indus River Basin, and (4) apply these two tools to produce results to inform decision making. This report summarizes all objectives and presents the challenges, pathways, solutions, and recommendations derived from this flagship project.

### Summary of Objectives

#### Objective 1 

The water crisis in Pakistan is not only due to water scarcity but also due to lack of governance for implementing effective water management strategies. Keeping in mind the present and future water crisis, the feasible management strategies can only be implemented when the options are evaluated in an integrated way and presented to stakeholder with strong evidence supported by scientific data. Thus a project under the umbrella of USPCASW was developed under the theme of strengthening the water governance. The prime goal of the project was to develop a baseline model and data dissemination portal for decision making for water resources and planning at the country level.
