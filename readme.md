### Abstract

The USAID-funded U.S.-Pakistan Center for Advanced Studies in Pakistan (USPCAS-W) conducted a flagship project from 2015 to 2017 to develop capacity to enable USPCAS-W decision support for Indus River management. The objectives of the Indus River Basin Water Management Modeling and Decision Support project were to (1) create a database supporting water management and system dynamics modeling of the Indus River Basin, (2) create a water management model using WEAP, (3) create a system dynamics model of the Indus River Basin, and (4) apply these two tools to produce results to inform decision making. This report summarizes all objectives and presents the challenges, pathways, solutions, and recommendations derived from this flagship project.

### Summary of Objectives

#### Objective 1 - Database for Upper and Lower Indus Basin
The goals of this objective were to establish a data sharing portal and develop water management model for informed decision making among organizations responsible for water planning and governance at national level. And the second goal was capacity building of water management sector for implementing the portal and water management model to develop a decision support system for improving water governance to tackle any future water crisis in Pakistan.  

#### Objective 2 - Water Management Models
Indus Basin is one of the largest river basins in the world, which provides a major portion of water to the population of approximately 100 million. The future availability of the water due to uncertainty in precipitation and temperature possess an immense threat for the inhabitants of this area. It is therefore important to quantify the changes in the future precipitation and temperature to determine the probable impacts on the water availability and hence providing a way forward to improve the system efficiency. This objectives focuses on downscaling of precipitation and mean temperature simulations, from an ensemble of 10 GCMs that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-5 (CMIP5) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), to 1 km resolution using the quantile mapping-delta (QMD) method over Indus River Basin and Pakistan. The results indicated that the projected changes in the temperature is much more certain than precipitation.

#### Objective 3 - Informing Decision Making
The Indus River Basin can be divided into two parts, (i) Upper Indus Basin (UIB) and (ii) Lower Indus basin. The UIB consists of major reservoir structures, while the LIB has diversion structures to route the water to the agricultural land. The Indus River Basin system has gone through a multitude of development phases, especially after the Indus Water Treaty (IWT). Pursuant to this treaty, Pakistan started the Indus Basin Project (IBP) consisting of the Tarbela, Mangla, and Chashma. During this period, a dispute had also been festering among the provinces of Pakistan for the equitable distribution of water resources in the Indus Basin which drastically impacted the water resource development. Subsequently, in 1991, the Water Apportionment Accord (WAA), was signed to protect the existing utilization of canal water in each province and apportion the balance of river supplies, including flood surpluses and future storages among the provinces. The resources were distributed amongst the provinces according to their demands with Punjab, Sindh, NWFP and Baluchistan receiving 37%, 37%, 14% and 12% of the Balance river supplies including food supplies and future storages.
This objective discusses the management solutions for the structures in UIB to improve the performance in terms Reliability, Resilience, and vulnerability under climate change and demand change scenarios. Furthermore, the effect of the management solutions on the water accord for the Sindh Province, and performance of the Barrages were also investigated.


#### Objective 4 - System Dynamics Model (System Dynamic Modelling of Impacts of Population Growth and Temperature)
The changing climate and increasing population in developing countries are the most important external factors resulting in water scarcity and food security. To address the problems, this objective focuses towards creation of system dynamics model to evaluate the impacts of population increase and climate change on agriculture sector. The results based on different scenarios and probable future intervention strategies showed that there was no immediate need to increase the area under cultivation, and enhancing the productivity of the area will suffice. For the water security, the rate in increase in population must be maintained at a value less than the baseline value.
